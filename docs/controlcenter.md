# Control Center


The [Control Center](https://tekniverse.teknikio.com/tools/control-center) can be found on all Tekniverse Apps (mobile, mac, and web). This page serves as a dashboard for all of the sensors and outputs on your board, so that you can verify that everything is working. For Tekniverse users you can also save incoming data and share a live stream of your Control Center with your collaborators!

The "controls" are the gray buttons with corresponding icons for each component of Bluebird. For example, if you click on the button it will turn green to show that it is active.

For inputs, like the accelerometer, clicking on the button will show or hide a graph with data being plotted over time.

For outputs you will see a pop-up configuration window that allows you to set the property of the component. For example, if you click on the LED, you will see a window with different color options for the LED.

Try clicking on the music button, you should see a playable keyboard! If you play these keys you will hear the notes played on the speaker of your board.

The graphs have additional buttons where you can customize the units or axis that you are viewing. For example, on the accelerometer graph you can choose the x, y, z axis or some combination of all 3!
For the temperature graph you can display the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.

 ## Going "Live"

 On the Control Center you will see a button labeled "go Live". This allows you to share real-time data coming in from your board with your "collaborators". To add a "collaborator" go to the "settings" page under your account and scroll to the bottom. You can add a collaborator using the username or email on their tekniverse account. If they don't have an account, share the link to sign up- it's free!

 Once you have added collaborators, they will get a notification whenever you click the 'go Live' button that prompts them to open their Control Center, where they will see a copy of your live Control Center! This is especially useful when working remotely, or if one person in a project group does not have hardware- they can ask you to set up an experiment and see the data come in real time from hundreds of miles away! The magic of IoT!
