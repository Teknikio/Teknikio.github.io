You can review each commit and select to restore your project to that commit.


## What happens when I clear the browser's cache and temporary files? #clear-data

When you clear browsing data, all of the saved projects and files that support MakeCode working offline are removed. Any project that you've shared to the public cloud is still there.

<!-- ## Where does a project that I share go? #sharing -->


<!-- ## What are some additional ways I can share projects with teachers and friends? #share-options

* Use the share button to publish your project to the MakeCode cloud. You can send the share URL that's created to anyone.
* The share URL can be pasted into a OneNote page or inserted as an embedded link on a website. In some cases, the link will be automatically expand into a read-only editor view of your project.
* You can save the project and copy it to a class website or to an approved location on the class or school network.
* You can copy code from and paste code into the JavaScript view of the editor. This let's you move code between MakeCode and other applications on your computer or device. -->

## Why does the editor still use the previous project name if I renamed the download file?

When you download the program for your project, the name you gave the project becomes part of the download file. If you decide to rename the download file, the name you chose for the project, not the current filename, is used and displayed by the editor.


## Where is the "Add Package" button?

Packages were renamed to **Extensions** to align with other code editors. You will now find the **Extensions** menu selection that replaces the **Add Package** button.

## How can I share tutorials? #share-tutorials

To share your tutorial you will need to prepare a step-by-step guide with photos or drawings for each step of the project. If you are not able to add photos, you can send us your project concept and we will do our best to remake it and post it for you!

1. Log in with your Tekniverse account and navigate to the [profile" page](https://tekniverse.teknikio.com/profile). On the Inventions tab you will see a button labeled "Add Invention"
2. You will be directed to a form for uploading inventions. Follow the steps to fill in the overview information on the first page. You will also select products you used, other materials, and upload any additional files, like a template for a 3D model.
3. Next, you will add the steps. Each step requires a title and description and a photo or diagram is strongly recommended. You can also add code files on steps where programming is required.
4. When you are all set, click Preview to make sure you like what you see. Next you will be ready to submit for review.

<!-- ## How do I choose the folder where my downloaded projects are saved?

Most browsers will let you turn on a setting to require the browser to first ask you where you want to save your files before they are downloaded.

* On Microsoft Edge you open the browser menu and select **Settings**. In the "General" settings pane, scroll down to the **Downloads** section. Turn **ON** the "Ask me what to do with each download" setting.
* In Chrome, you go to the **Settings** item in the browser menu. On the "Settings" page, click on **Advanced** to view more settings. Under the advanced settings find the **Downloads** section. In that section, turn **ON** the "Ask where to save each file before downloading" setting. -->
